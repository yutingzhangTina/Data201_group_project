This project mainly collects raw data from the website, cleans it and integrates it to generate various easy-to-understand charts to get the parts we are interested in. The raw data mainly includes three parts: tuition income from higher international education in New Zealand, the number of people in New Zealandâ€™s tourism industry, and Import and export products. We analyze the changes in New Zealand's international economy in recent years by analyzing the data of these three major industries.
